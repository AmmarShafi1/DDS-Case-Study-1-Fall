# Employee Attrition Analysis for Frito Lay - DDSAnalytics

## Executive Summary
DDSAnalytics, a leading talent management analytics firm, conducted an in-depth analysis of employee attrition for Frito Lay, aiming to identify the primary factors influencing turnover and predict which employees may be more likely to leave. Using a comprehensive dataset provided by Frito Lay, this project investigates key drivers of attrition, uncovers job role-specific trends, and builds a predictive model to assist in proactive retention strategies. 

## Introduction
Employee attrition remains a critical concern in talent management, particularly within large organizations seeking to retain high-potential employees and minimize the costs associated with turnover. Frito Lay, a prominent brand under PepsiCo, has partnered with DDSAnalytics to leverage advanced analytics in understanding and mitigating attrition. This project involves analyzing a rich dataset to reveal patterns and factors influencing employee turnover and build a model that can predict future attrition risks.

### Data

The charts display key demographic data for the organization. The first chart shows a higher number of male members (516) compared to females (354). The second chart highlights the age distribution, with the majority of members in the 30-40 age group (381), followed by the 20-30 group (172) and the 40-50 group (215). The third chart reveals that most employees are in the "Research & Development" department (562), while fewer are in "Sales" (273) and "Human Resources" (35). The maximum age in the dataset is 60, and the minimum age is 18.

Here we can see that there are similar distributions with gender, age, and attrition. When looking at the percentages, we can see that they are about even ecpet for the youngest of males which have a high percentage of attrition.

The first chart shows that attrition is highest for employees with 0 to 5 years of total working experience, with a noticeable drop in attrition for employees with more than 15 years of experience. The second chart indicates the attrition percentage based on how many years they have been at the company. The third chart reveals that attrition percentages much higher when the worker is further from home.

These will be the main attributes that we will use to build a predictive model for attrition.
